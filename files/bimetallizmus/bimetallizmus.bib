Abstract = {A longstanding puzzle in the bimetallic literature concerns the stability of the relative price of gold and silver in the absence of arbitrage possibilities in the major bimetallic countries in the 19th century. This paper offers a solution by developing a model of bimetallism that adds the 'disequilibrium' dynamics relevant when Gresham's law has driven out the 'good money'. The model demonstrates how the bimetallic mint ratios of major countries acted as sets of regulating barriers to stabilize the relative price of gold and silver. An empirical investigation confirms the presence of the associated target-zone effects in bimetallic data.

  abstract = {Bimetallism has been the subject of considerable debate: Was it a viable monetary system? Was it desirable? In our model, the amounts of each metal are split between coined metal, satisfying a cash-in-advance constraint, and uncoined metal, yielding utility. The ratio of the monies in the cash-in-advance constraint is endogenous. Bimetallism is feasible: we find a continuum of steady states indexed by the constant exchange rate of the monies. Bimetallism is not desirable: among steady states, welfare under monometallism is higher than under any bimetallic equilibrium. Long-run trends in gold and silver production placed limits on the maintenance of bimetallism at any given ratio, but its sudden collapse in 1873 remains a puzzle.},

Abstract = {The U.S. Coinage Act of 1873 eliminated provision for the free coinage of silver. That act cast the die for a gold standard. The conventional view is that "the act of 1873 was a piece of good fortune." This paper indicates that it was the opposite?a mistake that had highly adverse consequences. This is a judgment about 1873, not 1896. By 1896, when William Jennings Bryan ran for president on a "free-silver ticket," it was too late to undo the damage. Bryan was trying to close the barn door after the horse had been stolen.

  abstract = {The traditional explanation for the emergence of the gold standard emphasizes the fall in the price of silver in the 1870s and the desire of various European countries to emulate Britain's economic success. The argument here is that the ability to issue token coins was a necessary prerequisite for the gold standard. France chose abimetallic standard in the reform of 1803 because, in the absence of token coins, bimetallism provided a superior medium of exchange. Innovations in minting technology permitted France to introduce a token silver coinage and a de facto gold standard in the 1850s.},

In our set-up the agents know with certainty both the initial exogenous process and the new process to be adopted when the switch occurs. However, they do not know with certainty the timing of future switch as it depends on the path followed by the (stochastic) exchange rate. The model is discussed in terms of the British return to pre-war parity, in 1925. However, our results are applicable to a variety of situations where process switching depends on the motion of a key endogenous variable.},

Yet history contradicts both of these forms. In fact, the exchange rate has never been fixed, and we doubt it ever could be. We propose a new version of the law that is more feasible and more consistent with the evidence. It requires a fixed transaction cost of using currencies at nonparprices for the rule to apply.
