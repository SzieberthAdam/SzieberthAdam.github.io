<u>LEGO inventory management with Python</u>                           

In  September of 2018  I took home my childhood  LEGO collection
which was kept by my mother. Before handling towards my children
I intended  to create an inventory and  to sell weapons and some
other weird items.                                              

I created my inventory using  <a href="http://brickstock.patrickbrans.com">BrickStock</a>  and intended to do the
selling on <a href="https://www.bricklink.com">BrickLink</a>.  However, adding items to BrickLink seemed
to be a pain,  thus I wrote some  Python code to utilize its API
for the task.                                                   

• <a href="http://github.com/BrickBytes/bsx">BSX file handler</a>                                              
• <a href="http://github.com/BrickBytes/bricklink_api">BrickLink API handler</a>                                         
                                       
As usual, I never go to the point to get the selling done.
